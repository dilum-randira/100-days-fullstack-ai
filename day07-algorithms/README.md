# Day 7 – TypeScript Algorithms Practice

On Day 7, I practiced basic algorithms in TypeScript: **sorting**, **searching**, and
small **utility helpers** for arrays.

The goal is to understand how these algorithms work step-by-step, with clear and
readable code rather than micro-optimizations.

## Project Structure

- `src/algorithms/sorting.ts` – `bubbleSort`, `selectionSort`, `quickSort`
- `src/algorithms/searching.ts` – `linearSearch`, `binarySearch`
- `src/algorithms/utils.ts` – `findMax`, `findMin`, `buildFrequencyMap`
- `src/example.ts` – Runs all algorithms on a sample numbers array.

## How to Run

From inside the `day07-algorithms` folder:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the TypeScript project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run the example script:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

You should see the original numbers, sorted arrays from each algorithm,
search results for a target value, and utility outputs printed to the console.
